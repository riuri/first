First
========

This is my first repository. I intend to use it as a test.

Shell script
------------

A simple shell script. To run it, just type `./hello.sh` on the terminal.

C
---

To compile it, just type `./configure && make` on the terminal. Run with `./hello`.

To install, type `sudo make install` or similar on the terminal. It also installs the shell script.
