First
========

This is my first repository. I intend to use it as a test.

Shell script
------------

A simple shell script. To run it, just type `./hello.sh` on the terminal.

C
---

To compile it, type
```bash
autoreconf --install
./configure
make
```
You can now run it with `./hello`.

To install, type `make install` after compilation. The installation process also installs the shell script.
