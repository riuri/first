First
========

This is my first repository. I intend to use it as a test.

Compilation
------------
To compile it, just type `./configure && make` on the terminal. You can now run it with `./hello`.
There is also a simple shell script. To run it, just type `./hello.sh` on the terminal.

To install, type `sudo make install` or similar on the terminal after compilation.
The installation process also installs the shell script.

Commiting
---------
Before commiting, make sure you have run `make distclean`
